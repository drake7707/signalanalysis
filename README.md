# Signal analysis
A small project to analyse a CSV file columns and do signal analysis on its values to see if there is useful information to be extracted, such as periodicity (FFT) and other statistical values such as variance, kurtosis, gini coÃ«fficient, etc.

## Running locally

I used VSCode, which has built in typescript support. To debug it uses a tiny webserver to host the files on localhost. 

To run do `npm install` to restore packages and then `npm start` to start the webserver
